In this challenge, you need to write JavaScript that 
provides the following experience: when a user selects 
one of the thumbnail images using the mouse or keyboard, 
that image should be displayed in the full-size image 
container at the top. Updating the image should also 
update its alt attribute. To test keyboard interactivity,
 you can Tab to one of the thumbnails and press the Enter key.

Some of the methods we discussed in the previous 
assignment might be helpful here, but you should
 also use the jQuery docs and Google if you're not 
 sure what to do here. Researching on your own is a 
 key skill, and it'll get easier with practice.
